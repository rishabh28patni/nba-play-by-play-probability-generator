# nba-play-by-play-probability-generator
A project that will extract play by play data from the stats.nba.com website, then apply some sort of predictive model to get a probability prediction of a player scoring on a certain shot (ex. LeBron scoring a 26' jumpshot with nearest defender Kawhi Leonard 4 feet away).
